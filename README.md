Analyzing Weather Condtions

Overview

In this project, we are analyzing datasets for weather in Oahu, Hawaii. We are planning to open a store that sells surfboards and ice cream, but will need investor backing. The investor, W. Avy, would like weather data analyzed to determine if this is a good company for him to invest in. The main concern is about how the temperature differs in certain seasons and if this company is sustainable to be in business year-round.

Results

December vs June Temperature:

-The maximum recorded temperature is June is approximately 85 degrees, which is only 2 degrees higher than the maximum temperature recorded in December.

-The month of December does get colder than June, with a minimum temperature of 56 degrees.

-December weather has more fluctuation than the temperatures in June, as demonstrated by the bell curves in each graph below.

Summary

The temperatures in December do fluctuate more than the temperatures in June, but I would argue that it is not enough of a difference to affect business much. The average temperatures differ by about four degrees. Based on the data, the shop is sustainable to be open year-round instead of just seasonally. 

In addition to this analysis, I would recommend analyzing the temperature in other Hawaii islands and see how they compare. This can help us determine if Oahu is the optimal place for opening the store. Another weather analysis I would recommend reviewing is the wind. Wind can affect surfing conditions, which can in turn, affect business. Knowing if certain months are more affected by windiness can also help determine how sustainable the business will be year-round and which seasons we can expect to be busiest.
